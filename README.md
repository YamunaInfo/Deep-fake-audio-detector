# Deep-fake-audio-detector
Deepfake Audio Detector is a real-time machine learning system that identifies whether a voice is real or AI-generated. It analyzes live audio using features like MFCCs and classifies speech to detect synthetic or spoofed voices, helping prevent voice fraud, impersonation, and deepfake audio attacks.
